# Day 18 · Asynchronous Programming

Server demonstrates callbacks, promises, and async/await control-flow.

## Usage

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Try it

- `GET /callbacks` – runs an error-first callback pattern.
- `GET /promises` – resolves via `.then`/`.catch`.
- `GET /promises?fail=true` – shows rejection handling.
- `GET /async-await` – chains two awaited tasks and returns combined output.
